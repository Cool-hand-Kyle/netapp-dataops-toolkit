The NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments is a Python library
that makes it simple for developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and data engineers to perform various
data management tasks, such as provisioning a new data volume,
near-instantaneously cloning a data volume, and near-instantaneously
snapshotting a data volume for traceability/baselining. This Python library can
function as either a command line utility or a library of functions that can be 
imported into any Python program or Jupyter Notebook.

Refer to the documentation for a full list of available functionality.
